<summary><strong>In which Format Data must be presented?</strong></summary>
<br>
Final output should be generated by Scrapy framework in GeoJSON format with such data attributes:

| Name | Required? | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ref`           | Yes | A unique identifier for this feature inside this spider. The code that generates the output will remove duplicates based on the value of this key. 
| `chain_id`      | Yes | Static attribute. Read more here [Place s  category system](https://developer.here.com/documentation/geocoding-search-api/dev_guide/topics-places/places-chain-system-full.html)
| `chain_name`    | Yes | Static attribute. Must be defined like = `self.brand_name`
| `addr_full`     | No  | Usually this follows the format of street, city, province, postcode address. This field might exist instead of the other address-related fields, especially if the spider can't reliably extract the individual parts of the address.
| `housenumber`   | No  | The house number part of the address.
| `street`        | No  | The street name.
| `city`          | No  | The city part of the address.

| `country`       | No  | The country part of the address.
| `phone`         | No  | The telephone number for the venue. Note that this is usually pulled from a website assuming local visitors, so it probably doesn't include the country code.
| `website`       | No  | Static URL of the website from which you collect data. Example https://www.mcdonalds.rs/
| `store_url`     | No  | Dynamic URL of the page on the website. Usually we add this attribute when website renders information about different places on a different pages.
